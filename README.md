# CS255-Portfolio
Portfolio for CS 255 showcasing business requirements and system design documents


# Project Summary

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a driving school client who wanted a platform to manage student driving lessons efficiently. 
The system allows students to view available time slots, book lessons, manage their credits, and receive confirmation notifications.
Instructors can manage their availability and confirm lessons, while administrators can oversee the system and handle maintenance requests. 
The goal was to create a user-friendly and reliable platform that streamlined scheduling and communication for all users.


# What I Did Well

I believe I did particularly well in modeling the system with detailed UML diagrams. 
My diagrams clearly illustrate how students, instructors, and the system interact, including backend services and database interactions. 
I also ensured that the documentation was structured and easy to understand, making it easier for future developers or team members to continue working with the system.


# Part I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be adding more alternative flows in the sequence diagrams. 
While the main process is well-documented, including additional error handling and edge cases (such as scheduling conflicts or invalid input) would make the design more robust. 
I would improve this by explicitly modeling these scenarios so the system can handle unexpected events gracefully.


# Interpreting User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the client’s requirements and translating them into system features, such as the booking workflow, notification service, and credit management. 
Considering the user’s perspective is critical because a system that meets technical requirements but ignores usability will likely fail in practice. 
Understanding user interactions ensures the system is intuitive, reliable, and effective.


# Approach to Designing Software

My approach to designing software involves first gathering clear requirements, then modeling the system using UML diagrams such as use case, activity, and sequence diagrams. 
In future projects, I plan to continue using structured diagramming, iterative testing, and feedback cycles. 
I also aim to focus on maintainability and scalability from the start, ensuring the system can adapt to future changes without major redesigns.
